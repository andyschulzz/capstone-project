# Pumpele

I developed Pumpele as my final project during the [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de) web developer bootcamp in spring 2020.

It is a workout planner and knowledge base app made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The user can create different workouts and track his progress or a get a deeper understanding about a variety of exercises from the database.
